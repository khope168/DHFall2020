        <h1><cite>Money <br /> Pink Floyd</cite></h1>
        <p>Money, get away <br />You get a good job with more pay and you're okay <br /> Money, it's
            a gas <br />Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash <br />New car, caviar,
            four-star daydream <br />Think I'll buy me a football team</p>
        <h2>$$$</h2>
        <p>Money, get back <br />I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack <br />Money,
            it's a hit <br />Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit <br />I'm in the
            high-fidelity first class travelling set <br />And I think I need a Lear jet</p>
        <h2>$$$</h2>
        <p>Money, it's a crime <br />Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie <br />Money,
            so they say <br />Is the root of all evil today <br />But if you ask for a rise, it's no
            surprise <br />That they're giving none away</p>
        <h2>$$$</h2>
        <p>Away, away, away <br />Away, away, away <br />Away, ooh...</p>
        <h2>$$$</h2>
        <i>- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right! - Yes, absolutely in the right! - I certainly
            was in the right! - Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a
            bruising... - Yeah - Why does anyone do anything? - I don't know, I was really drunk at
            the time... - I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was
            asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and
            telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which
            sorted the matter out</i>
